If a single action, like a click, triggers TWO commands - like for instance, if clicking anywhere in a widget selects it, and clicking a button within it also contacts the DB - then only the first one runs and I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY. I can't debug it because every time I pause the code to step through it, the behavior changes! I suppose that in itself helps me narrow it down some - it must be a timing issue in some way - but I'm really stumped. I'll work on it some more today, I guess.

"I made an appointment to get my cat fixed, vaccinated, etc. I'd been really stressing about this for the last few weeks, because of several factors. She's a former stray and not all vets are willing to treat her decently - the first place I called wanted me to bring her in in a trap and tip her ear, like a wild animal! Also, because she's a stray I have no idea how old she is, but she looks more than old enough to have kittens, and I can't afford them, so I was in a hurry to get her fixed. Now that I have an appointment for next week, at a place that will actually treat her like a PET, which she IS, I feel better. I still have to figure out how I'm going to get her into the cat carrier that morning - I fully expect her to panic over some noise or other the night before, hide under the bed and refuse to come out - but at least it's only ONE thing to worry about, and after that, it's all downhill unless she gets an infection.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,family

I had been talking to someone who I had thought was a friend but they wound up telling lies. The friendship had turned quickly into something of a relationship more on their end and lies were told by me in order for them to send me money. I finally decided to tell them that I wanted to have the truth and honesty back which now has become very dramatic and time consuming. It is frustrating because they continue to play the victim despite the lies told by them and each conversation just goes in circles. I thought being honest was the best interest for the both of us but it seems to make things worse.I am frustrated that they do not see their wrong doings and due to me telling the truth they continue to bring up their hurt feelings and not acknowledging mine. I tried to block them and just stop speaking but was told to try and get more money from them which is what made things go horribly wrong but they did not even notice they were not even talking to me at all. They have personal information about me and keep using that as a weapon against me when all I want to do is either start over as friends as I intended or just stop communicating in whole.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,friends
